    <h1>Lions v. Pokemon</h1>
<p> We created a program using data on pokemon movesets & stats to answer the question of whether one billion lions or one of each pokemon would win. As going off pok√©dex entries is highly subjective, we used the classic game iteration of pokemon battles. The simulator is able to run different versions of the battles (e.g. level variations, taking pp into consideration, etc.) and chart the deaths/victories of each side. </p>
